# ðŸ§  Learning Journal

Welcome to my personal learning journalâ€”a space where I document my daily progress, discoveries, and reflections as I grow as a developer.

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find Here

- **Daily DSA Practice**  
  Topic-wise folders with problems I solve each day, including:
  - Problem statement
  - My initial approach
  - Final solution
  - Time & space complexity
  - Reflections and learnings

- **Code Snippets & Notes**  
  Handy tricks, patterns, and concepts I pick up along the way.

- **Project Logs (Coming Soon)**  
  As I start building projects, Iâ€™ll document the process here too.


## ðŸ§­ Why This Journal?

I started this repo to:
- Build consistency in my learning
- Reflect on what I understand (and what I donâ€™t)
- Create a public record of growth
- Improve my Git and GitHub workflow

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Solve at least one DSA problem daily
- Write clean, well-documented code
- Explore new algorithms and patterns
- Eventually contribute to open source

## ðŸ“… Started: August 2025

Feel free to explore, learn with me, or suggest improvements. This is a living journalâ€”and Iâ€™m just getting started.
